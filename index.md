**Orthogonal Research and Education Lab** (OREL) is a distributed collection of investigators pursuing interdisciplinary research and open science, while valuing the underpinning philosophy within disciplines and societal impact of advances in AI and other technologies. With projects spanning computer science, biology & neuroscience, and cognitive science & psychology, we foster collaboration and communication across diverse fields of study alongside development as researchers educators, and science communicators. OREL is led by Director of Science [Dr. Bradly Alicea](http://bradly-alicea.weebly.com/).
