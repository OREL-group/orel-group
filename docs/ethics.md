## Background
Founded officially in January 2021, the Ethics Team at Orthogonal Research and Education Lab has its roots in cross-disciplinary collaborations on law and technology. 
We examine various facets of technology's ever-expansive interfacing with society.
Topics of interest include: AI Ethics, AI Safety, law (particularly AI interpretability / explainability and legilation), shared risk, technology-education access, and neuroethics. 
- See **[OREL's Get Involved website](https://orel-group.github.io/join/)** for the most up to date list of opportunites.
